# AngularCodes

This is me learning about AngularJs and what it has to offer. The main point of entry for this application to work is the file main.ts . This file takes in the AppModule called and let those modules or components run within the index.html file. The tag <app-root> will let the Angular application runs for this project. There is a type of declarations within Angular that is called Decorators.
